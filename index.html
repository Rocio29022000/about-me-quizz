                <h2>Education </h2>
                <p> I was in the same school for 15 years! From early years through to A-levels, 
                    called Almunecar International School. </p>
                <p> Then I moved on to Leeds to join The University of Leeds, 
                    where I did a Medical Engineering integrated masters degree. 
                    Where I graduated last summer with a first class Honours degree! Yay! </p>

                <h2>Professional experience</h2>
                <p> I have a very short professional experience... 
                    Just as I graduated Uni I joined CMR Surgical to work as a Graduate portfolio Strategist. 
                    But I recently got made redundant due to the company downsizing big time :( </p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p> The main goal in my life is to leave this world having done something that has made 
                    it a better place! This is why I went for the MedTech industry! My greatest passion is to 
                    use my knowledge and skills to problem solve challenges that could have an impact on someones 
                    quality of life.</p>
